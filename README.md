# Tetration Excel Exporter

This script allows a user to export policy generated by Tetration into an Excel file format with three tabs: Clusters, Filters, and Policies

# Dependencies

```
pip install tetpyclient xlsxwriter terminaltables
```

# Usage

Before using, make sure that you update your Tetration API key in the file policy_xlsx.py if you want to connect directly to Tetration.  Optionally the '--config' argument can be passed at the command line to an exported json file from the ADM workspace.

```
python policy_xlsx.py
```
